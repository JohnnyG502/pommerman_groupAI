## Dev Setup - Idea

We currently are using just one branch.
Each groupmember gets its own folder in the previous discussed topic (folder).
If this approach doesn't work we might want to change to a different structure.

## Pommerman Integration

since we won't put our ideas/approaches into the github repositories of the used environments, please place this repo next to the env. repo and connect agent via pathing
